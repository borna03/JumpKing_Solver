# JumpKing Solver Project

## Project Status
The JumpKing Solver is currently in development. This project aims to solve all levels of the game using a unique approach that does not rely on neural networks.

## Methodology
The solver generates a number of jumpers (`n` jumpers), tracks the performance of each, and remembers the moves of the most successful ones. It can replicate these successful moves perfectly, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in navigating through the game levels.

## Current Features
- **Level Creation**: All game levels have been created and can be interacted with by the solver.
- **Player Controls**: Implementation of player controls is underway. While the basic framework is in place, refinements are needed to enhance playability and control precision.
- Generate new jumpers by 'u', by pressing 't' to replicate the run of the most successful jumper.
- Use the arrow keys up and down to move the frame.
